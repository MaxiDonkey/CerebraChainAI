For each theme listed in the previous JSON, define a response (or data) structure:
- Design a format that allows for the collection, organization, and presentation of information (for example, a JSON format with fields such as subquery, response, references, analysis, etc.).
- Ensure the consistency and reusability of this structure for potential use by automated systems or future reviews.

Respond strictly following the JSON format below and no code container:
{
  "context": {
    "question": "Exact title or statement of the question",
    "objectives": "What we aim to understand or demonstrate",
    "scope": "Scope or limitations (timeframe, geography, etc.)"
  },
  "themes": [
    {
      "theme_name": "Theme name",
      "key_points": [
        "Key idea 1",
        "Key idea 2",
        "Key idea 3"
      ]
    }
    // Repeat for each theme
  ],
  "subqueries": [
    {
      "theme": "Theme name",
      "questions": [
        "Sub-question 1",
        "Sub-question 2",
        "Sub-question 3"
      ]
    }
    // Repeat for each theme
  ]
}
